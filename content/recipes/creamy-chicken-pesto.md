## Ingredients

- 1 lb. uncooked farfalle (bow-tie) pasta
- 1 tbsp. olive oil
- 2 lb. boneless chicken breasts, cut into bite-sized pieces
- Salt and pepper to taste
- Garlic powder to taste
- 7 oz. jar pesto
- 2 cups chicken broth

## Directions

1. Cook the bow-tie pasta in a large pot of salted boiling water according to package directions. Drain and set aside.
2. In a large skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add chicken, season with salt, pepper, and garlic powder. Cook until chicken is browned and cooked through, about 6-8 minutes.
3. Reduce heat to medium. Add chicken broth and cream cheese to the skillet. Stir until cream cheese is melted and sauce is smooth.
4. Stir in the pesto. Mix until well combined and heated through.
5. Add the drained pasta to the skillet and toss until everything is coated in the creamy pesto sauce.
6. Serve warm. Garnish with fresh Parmesan cheese or fresh basil if desired.
