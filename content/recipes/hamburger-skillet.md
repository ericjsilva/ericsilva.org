A simple one-pot, do-it-yourself hamburger skillet meal. Adjust to your family's personal preferences and tastes.

## Ingredients

- 1 lb. lean ground beef
- 1 medium yellow or sweet onion (diced)
- 2 bell peppers (color of your choice) (diced)
- 1 cup corn (frozen or fresh)
- 2 cans (10 oz.) petite diced tomatoes or Rotel with green chile (spicy!)
- 1 can (15.5 oz) black beans (drained and rinsed)
- 1-2 tbsp. Worcestershire sauce
- 2 cups beef bullion (pre-made, or use cubes or paste)
- 1 tsp. chili powder
- 1 cup uncooked rice or 1 cup dry pasta (elbows work great)
- Salt
- Garlic powder
- Ground black pepper

## Directions

1. In a large skillet on medium-high heat, brown hamburger with salt, pepper, and garlic powder to taste.
2. When hamburger is mostly browned, add diced onion and bell pepper.
3. Once hamburger is browned and onion has softened, add diced tomatoes
4. Add the beef bullion, Worcestershire sauce, and chili powder. Stir to incorporate.
5. Add black beans and corn.
6. Bring contents to boil, reduce heat to low, and add rice or pasta. Stir to incorporate. Add additional water as needed (~ 1 cup). Rice or pasta will absorb most of the liquid during cooking.
7. Taste the broth and add additional salt or pepper to taste.
8. Simmer on low for 25 minutes until rice or pasta is tender.

Enjoy!
