## Ingredients

- 1 lb. ground beef
- 1 cup uncooked instant rice
- 2 cups beef broth
- 1 green pepper, diced
- 1 red pepper, diced
- 1 onion, minced
- 1 tbsp garlic, minced
- 12 oz. can tomato sauce
- 28 oz. can diced tomatoes with green chiles, un-drained
- salt and pepper to taste

## Directions

1. In your dutch oven, brown ground beef, onion, garlic and peppers.
2. Add salt and pepper to taste.
3. You can then heat beef broth with the hamburger mixture.
4. Add tomato sauce and diced tomatoes.
5. Stir well and and make sure that it is heated through.
6. Once hot, add uncooked rice and simmer until rice is done â€“ it will only take a few minutes.

   - You do have to watch this a bit as it can be hard to tell.
   - I always test it a few times to make sure the rice is how I like it.

Serves about 8.
