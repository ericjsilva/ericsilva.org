## Ingredients

For the stew:

- 2 lbs. cooked chicken, chopped or shredded
- 6-7 cups water 
- 4 cups chicken broth
- 1 medium yellow or sweet onion, diced
- 3 medium carrots, peeled and diced
- 4 medium potatoes, diced large (Yukon gold; peeled if preferred)
- 2 stalks celery, diced
- 1 clove garlic, minced (optional)
- 2 tbsp. butter
- 2 tbsp. all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp. salt, plus more to taste
- 1/2 tsp. seasoning salt
- 1/2 tsp. black pepper
- 1 tsp. dried thyme
- 1 tsp. dried parsley (optional)

For the homemade noodle dough (enough for the pot pie):

- 2 cups all-purpose flour, plus more for rolling
- 1 tsp. salt
- 2 large eggs, beaten
- 1/2 cup water


## Directions

### Make the noodle dough

1. Combine flour and salt together in a bowl.
2. Beat eggs in a small bowl.
3. Add water and mix together.
4. Make a well in the flour, pour in the wet mixture and mix until a shaggy dough forms.
5. Add a little more water, if needed until the kneaded dough comes together and forms a ball.
6. If it seems too sticky, just add a bit more flour.
7. Cover with a towel and set aside.

### Make the chicken pot pie

1. If you don't already have cooked chicken available, you will need to cook chicken. You can use a whole chicken, breast, thighs, or a combination. You can also get a rotisserie chicken from the grocery and use that for quick and easy.
2. Prepare the vegetables: In a large pot, melt 2 tbsp butter over medium heat. Add the onion, carrots, celery, and garlic and sauté until soft, about 3–4 minutes. 
3. Add the potatoes and chicken.
4. Add salt, seasoning salt, black pepper, thyme, and parsley.
5. Add chicken broth and 6 cups water to the pot. Stir and bring to a boil.
6. While waiting for everything to boil, flour your rolling surface and roll out the noodle dough to about 1/8" thick.
7. Using a noodle cutter, pizza cutter, or knife, cut the dough into 1 to 1-1/2" squares. It doesn't have to be perfect but they shouldn't be too big.
8. Once the broth is boiling, drop the dough pieces into the boiling liquid, making sure each piece does't touch the other pieces. If you try and pile too many in at once, they will stick together. Stir occasionally to mix. Resume adding noodles until they all are in.
9. Continue boiling for 30 minutes.
10. Make a paste with 2 tbsp. of flour and water. Slowly add to the pot and stir to slightly thicken the broth. Boil for another minute.
11. Taste and adjust salt and pepper to your family's preferences.

## Notes

- Traditional Pennsylvania Dutch "pot pie" is more like a thick chicken stew served over noodles or dumplings rather than a baked pie. These homemade noodles are tender and egg-forward; adjust thickness to preference.
- Feel free to adjust the vegetable type and quantity to your family's taste. Adding peas is a popular option.
- If you prefer a higher broth-to-noodles ration, simply add more broth.
- You can add more chicken, if desired.
- This is a homestyle Pennsylvania Dutch approach — family recipes vary widely; this version aims to be easy and flexible while keeping the classic noodle comfort.
