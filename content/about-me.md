{{< figure src="/img/about/eric_bw_profile-150x150.jpg" alt="Eric Silva" class="left">}}
I am currently working for [Pfizer](https://www.pfizer.com) in Collegeville, PA as a product technology specialist/strategist in the application engineering group within digital marketing.  I am responsible for integrating various systems involved with channel and analytics data, campaign management, user preferences, etc. using MuleSoft and other technologies.  I also support groups developing websites in [PHP](http://www.php.net) and [Drupal](https://drupal.org), and have been known to lend a hand to the groups developing native mobile applications.

Before than I was a Senior Enterprise Architect for [Cytel Inc.](http://www.cytel.com) in Chesterbrook, PA, and before that I was a software engineer and architect for Wyeth and Pfizer in Collegeville, PA. I concentrate on designing and building enterprise software in Java, .NET, and related technologies to support clinical trial design and execution with a strong focus in adaptive trials. I am a strong advocate of the [Feature Driven Development (FDD)](http://www.featuredrivendevelopment.com) process, [Modeling in Color](https://www.amazon.com/Java-Modeling-Color-UML-Enterprise/dp/013011510X), and [Peer Code Review](https://smartbear.com/product/collaborator/overview/).

I have been developing software since 1995 in Java, C#, Visual Basic, ASP, PHP, and C. My primary focus has been designing and developing web-based applications, although I have worked on my share of client applications, web services, and PL/SQL. I also do freelance web development in my spare time.

In additional to my Java, PHP, and C# background, I also have worked with Python and Ruby.

I live in [Birdsboro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdsboro,_Pennsylvania), a small town near Reading, PA with my two children. I grew up in [Alamogordo, NM](https://www.alamogordo.com) before coming to the Philadelphia area in 1997. I enjoy living in the northeast, but I do miss the sunsets, mild winters, and the mountains of the southwest.

I enjoy the outdoors, sports, woodworking, photography, space and spending time with my children. I also enjoy recreational math, crossword puzzles, beer, wine (mainly pinot noir and chardonnay), movies, and collecting Scouting patches, matchbooks and foreign coins. I enjoy watching and playing all sports and support the [Green Bay Packers](https://www.packers.com), [Chelsea FC](https://www.chelseafc.com), [New York Rangers](https://www.nhl.com/rangers/), and [Philadelphia Phillies](https://www.mlb.com/phillies).
