![profile](/img/about/eric_bw_profile-150x150.jpg#floatleft)
I am a software developer. I started with Fortran and Pascal in 1994-1995, and continued to C and Java in college. For 10 years after that I was a full-time software engineer building enterprise Java web applications, and dabbled with PHP and Javascript in my spare time.

I then did some work with C# and ASP.NET - these were the dark times. We no longer discuss this period in polite conversation.

For the last 10 years, I have continued developing in Java, but also began using PHP and Python.  I've also shifted away from application development, more heavily focused on cloud infrastructure and security primarily with Amazon Web Services. Most days I am writing Terraform HCL and Python functions. If you are really interested in my professional career, my [LinkedIn profile](https://linkedin.com/in/ericjsilva) is up-to-date.

I live in [Birdsboro](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Birdsboro,_Pennsylvania), a small town near Reading, PA with my two children, our dog, cat, guinea pigs, fish, and foster pets waiting to go to their furever home. I grew up in [Alamogordo, NM](https://www.alamogordo.com) before coming to the Philadelphia area in 1997. I enjoy living in the northeast, but I do miss the sunsets, mild winters, and the mountains of the southwest.

When I am not in front of a computer screen, I enjoy the outdoors, sports, woodworking, electronics, photography, and all things space related. I also enjoy recreational math, crossword puzzles, beer, wine, music and movies. 

I enjoy watching and playing all sports and support the [Green Bay Packers](https://www.packers.com), [Chelsea FC](https://www.chelseafc.com), [New York Rangers](https://www.nhl.com/rangers/), and [Philadelphia Phillies](https://www.mlb.com/phillies).
