January is National Mentoring Month, and within Scouting, we know first-hand how mentoring can play an important role in a young person’s life.

While an amazing troop leader, inspiring camp counselor, or lodge adviser can make a positive impact on our young people, Scouts aren’t just mentees – they also become mentors as the grow and guide the younger Scouts following in their path. The result is an incredible cycle of mentoring that continues for generations of Scouts to come!

One of Scouting Aims is Association with Adults. The adult volunteers in Scouting are one of our most precious resources. Scouts learn a great deal by watching how adults conduct themselves. Scout leaders can be positive role models for the members of their troops. In many cases a Scoutmaster who is willing to listen to the Scouts, encourage them, and take a sincere interest in them can make a profound difference in their lives. 

According to the National Mentoring Partnership, 1 in 3 young people will grow up without a mentor. Scouting helps bridge that gap by bringing more mentoring opportunities to more young people, and adult volunteers are critical in leading the way!

As a closing thought, I want to leave you with this… Mentors Gain as Much as they Give. As much as we, as volunteers, love to support our Scouts, I am quite confident that each of us feels that the relationship is equally rewarding as it is for the Scouts.

Thank you to each one of you for doing what you do for Scouting. Thank you for being here tonight, and have a safe journey home.
