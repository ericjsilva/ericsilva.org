At the beginning of each year, many of us tend to make "New Year’s Resolutions". In other words, we each make a goal that we would like to complete to make ourselves better. Often people run into the issue of making an un-attainable goal that will later cause them frustration. The key to making an attainable goal is to be specific and precise on what the result is. Also, come up with a way to measure your realistic goal. Don’t set yourself up for failure with a goal that you will never reach, but at the same time, your goal should be a challenge. Most of our Scouts set a goal for themselves to reach the rank of Eagle.  

Is it attainable? Yes. 
Is it a challenge? You better believe it.
Is it worth it? Every Eagle Scout I have talked to would say "yes".

As adults Scouters, we can also use the new year to set new goals to improve the program for our Scouts, their families, and for our fellow Scouters. You can set a goal to be a merit badge counselor, help a new parent get involved with your unit committee, or learn a new skill. Your goals can also be as simple as smiling throughout the day, or making someone’s day better by doing your good turn daily, or making yourself better with the many merits of Scouting. 

As we close here tonight, I challenge you to make one attainable goal this year that will not only better you personally, but also affect those around you in a strong and positive way and strengthen the Scouting program in which we all have dedicated our time and efforts.
