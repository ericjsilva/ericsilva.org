*I am only one, but I am one.*
*I cannot do everything, but I can do something.*
*I will not let what I cannot do interfere with what I can do.*
*And because I cannot do everything, I will not refuse to do the something that I can do.*

This quote from Edward Everett Hale reminds us that we need to look at what we can achieve rather than getting distracted by all the things we cannot do.

When we look around, there are many little things we can do to help our Scouts, our Packs and Troops, our fellow leaders, our Scouting families, and our neighbors. Focus on those things you can do instead of the big problems which seem impossible to solve. Who knows? Maybe if enough of us work on the things we can do, the things which seemed impossible may be within our reach.

I will finish tonight with a similar thought from Mother Teresa:

*If you can’t feed a hundred people, then feed just one.*

Thank you for being here tonight and thank you for volunteering your time in this thing called Scouting. If you can’t contribute 100 hours per week, then contribute just one.
