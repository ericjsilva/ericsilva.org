Life isn't about keeping score.
It's not about how many friends you have or how accepted you are.
It's not about if you have plans this weekend or not.
It isn't about who your family is or how much money they have or what kind of car you drive or where you go to school.
It's not about how handsome or ugly you are, the clothes you wear, the shoes you wear, or what kind of music you listen to.
It's not about if your hair is blonde, red, black, or brown or if your skin is too light or too dark.
It's not about how smart you are, or how smart everybody else thinks you are.
It's not about what clubs you're in or how good you are at "your" sport.

Life just isn't about those things.
Life is about choices.
It's about who you make happy. It's about kindness and generosity.
It's about holding and sharing trust. It's about friendship.
It's about faith, integrity, and character.
Most of all, it's about using your life to touch other people's hearts in such a way that could have never occurred alone.

Only you can choose the way those hearts are affected, and those choices make up what your life is all about.

Thank you for choosing to be here tonight. Thank you for choosing to be involved with Scouting, and providing a positive example and model for our young people. I wish you Happy Holidays, a very merry and prosperous New Year, and I look forward to serving you as we begin 2023.
