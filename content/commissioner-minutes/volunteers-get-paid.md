Most people do not realize that WE DO get paid when we volunteer with Scouts. 

The smiles we receive get directly deposited into our energy banks. The hugs and laughter frame our benefit plans. The high-fives after each accomplishment solidify our recognition and rewards system. S’mores, silly skits, and songs are the highlight of our personal time off. And when we go to the "office" to put in our one hour a week, we are surrounded by the most beautiful, landscaped "office" humans have ever known. 

And unlike the typical 9-to-5, when it comes time to retire we leave with a pocket full of faithful friends, a mind full of beautiful memories, and the satisfaction of knowing that what we did was important. We were needed and we will not be soon forgotten for we made a positive difference in the lives of our world’s children.
