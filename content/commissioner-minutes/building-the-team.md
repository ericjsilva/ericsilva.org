As Scout leaders, we teach our Scouts the importance of working together and building a strong team. We strive to live by the motto, "Be Prepared," and part of being prepared means being able to rely on each other. When we work together, we can accomplish great things that we wouldn't be able to achieve alone. Our Scouts also learn this important skill in other activities such as sports, music, and theater. Being part of a team teaches us valuable life skills, such as communication, problem-solving, and leadership. We learn how to listen to each other, respect different opinions, and work towards a common goal. These skills serve us well not just in Scouting, but in all areas of our lives.

As adults, we must also remember that we too need to develop relationships and build strong teams. Every parent and member of our Packs, Troops, and Crews has something valuable to contribute, whether it's a unique skill, a creative hobby, a positive attitude, or simply a willingness to lend a helping hand. By building a strong team, we can support each other, learn from each other, and achieve our common goal of delivering a quality Scouting program to our youth. We must remember to reach out to new Scouting families, talk to them, develop those relationships, and grow our teams.

Thank you for being here tonight and being a part of our Scouting team. I encourage you to look at the adults in the units you have contact with, and work to develop a relationship with someone who you think could make our team stronger.
