During my tenure as District Commissioner for Frontier District, Hawk Mountain Council, I shared brief moments of reflection and wisdom with fellow volunteers and Scouting leaders. These "Commissioner Minutes" were designed to inspire, encourage, and provide practical insights for those serving in Scouting leadership roles.

Each of these short pieces focuses on:

- **Leadership Development** - Practical wisdom for guiding others and leading by example
- **Character Building** - Stories and parables that illustrate important life values
- **Service and Volunteerism** - Reflections on the meaning and impact of service to others
- **Mentoring and Growth** - Insights on helping young people reach their potential
- **Resilience and Perseverance** - Encouragement for overcoming challenges and setbacks

These minutes were shared at district meetings, district Roundtable, and other gatherings where Scouting volunteers came together. While originally intended for fellow adult leaders, the timeless themes of personal growth, leadership, and character make these reflections relevant for anyone seeking to make a positive difference in their community.

The goal of each Commissioner Minute was simple: to provide a moment of pause, reflection, and inspiration that volunteers could carry with them as they continued their important work of developing the next generation of leaders through the Scouting program.
