I entered my tent at 2:45pm and got situated. My Big Agnes Copper Spur HV UL1 tent, Nemo Tensor insulated sleeping pad, Eureka Casper 15Â° sleeping bag, Sea to Summit Thermolite Reactor bag liner, and Outdoor Vitals Ultralight Stretch Pillow.

I also brought my phone and iPad to record and livestream the challenges and make regular updates on social media.

The afternoon went well with several Facebook live streams and Instagram posts. I completed the knot demonstrations and also made a woggle for a friend.

I made a Mountain House Chicken Polynesian meal for dinner, watched the new Season 2 episode of The Mandalorian on Disney+, and a movie on Netflix and then went to bed.
