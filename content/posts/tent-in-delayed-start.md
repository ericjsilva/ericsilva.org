I had fully intended to be in the tent starting at 12:00pm EDT, but I had some work and personal things pop-up that could not be avoided and so I am delayed a bit. I am working to get things setup and should be in the tent and online by 2:00pm.

Also, some additional donations have come in, and I am over the $2,900 mark, so I will be rounding up to 30 hours. If you want to keep this going longer, you can [still donate](http://bit.ly/eric-tent-in).

Remember, I am also going to livestream and post video from inside the tent on my [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCRU2V3vwu0alLjl40gG5_tQ) and on [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/airickswirld) and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/ericjsilva) as well. Keep an eye out.
