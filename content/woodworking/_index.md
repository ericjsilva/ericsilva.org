Welcome to my woodworking project documentation. Here you'll find detailed guides for projects I've completed, including materials lists, step-by-step instructions, and the inevitable lessons learned along the way.

Each project includes:
- Complete materials and tools list
- Step-by-step build process
- Safety considerations and tips
- Lessons learned and what I'd do differently
- Cost breakdowns and time estimates

Whether you're a beginner looking for your first project or an experienced woodworker seeking inspiration, these guides aim to help you create something beautiful and functional while learning from my successes and mistakes.
