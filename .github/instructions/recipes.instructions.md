# Recipe Blog Post Instructions

When creating recipe posts, focus on combining personal storytelling with practical cooking guidance.

## Content Structure
- **Personal Story**: Start with the story behind the dish - family history, cultural significance, or special memories
- **Ingredient List**: Use specific measurements and include sourcing notes for special ingredients
- **Instructions**: Provide clear, tested steps with helpful tips integrated naturally
- **Variations**: Share modifications you've tried and dietary alternatives
- **Storage & Serving**: Include practical information about leftovers, reheating, and presentation

## Writing Style
- Use conversational, authentic tone
- Include personal anecdotes that enhance understanding
- Share both successes and failures honestly
- Provide troubleshooting tips based on real experience
- Connect the dish to broader themes (family, culture, seasons, occasions)

## Technical Details
- Include prep time, cook time, and serving information
- Specify cooking temperatures and times precisely
- Mention any special equipment needed
- Provide substitution options for hard-to-find ingredients

## Quality Standards
- All recipes should be personally tested
- Include yield information (serves X people)
- Provide both metric and imperial measurements when helpful
- Add difficulty level if appropriate (beginner, intermediate, advanced)
